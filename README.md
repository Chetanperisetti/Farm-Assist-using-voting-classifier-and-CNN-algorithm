# Farm Assist using voting classifier and CNN algorithm

Welcome to the Farm Assistant project, an initiative aimed at supporting Indian farmers by leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to provide valuable recommendations for crop selection and pest management.

## Introduction

The Farm Assistant project addresses the challenges faced by Indian farmers, including soil degradation, crop selection, pest management, and pesticide selection. By utilizing modern technologies like ML and DL, we aim to empower farmers with data-driven recommendations to improve agricultural productivity and livelihoods.

## Objective

The primary objectives of the Farm Assistant project are as follows:

1. **Precision Agriculture Implementation**: Utilize research data on soil characteristics, soil types, and crop yield to recommend suitable crops for specific land conditions, thereby increasing productivity.

2. **Ensemble Model Recommendation System**: Develop a recommendation system based on ensemble models with a majority voting technique, ensuring accurate and efficient crop recommendations.

3. **Pest Recognition and Pesticide Recommendation**: Go beyond pest recognition by recommending appropriate pesticides available in India, adhering to quality and safety standards.

4. **User-Friendly Web Application**: Design a user-friendly web application interface to provide farmers with easy access to precision agriculture, crop recommendation, and pesticide recommendation services.

## Features

- Accurate crop recommendations based on site-specific parameters.
- Pest recognition through image upload or manual selection.
- User-friendly web application interface for easy navigation.
- Integration and analysis of data from various sources.
- Compliance with ISO standards for pesticide recommendations.
- Focus on adoption and awareness among farmers.
- Scalability and adaptability to address agricultural challenges in different regions.
